    This file contains the template for Assignment3. For testing it, I will place it
    in a different directory, call the function <min_steps_flood_escape>, and check its output.
    So, you can add/remove  whatever you want to/from this file. But, don't change the name
    of the file or the name/signature of the following function.

    I will use <python3> to run this code.

def min_steps_flood_escape(grid: list[str]) -> int:
    '''
    Compute the minimum number of steps to reach the shelter, in a board specified by
    a list of strings; grid[i] is the ith row of the grid.  grid[i][j] is the character
    at the intersection of row i and column j.

    @param grid: list[str] - representing the board.
    Output: minium number of steps to reach from the initial point top-left to the
    shelter bottom-right.
